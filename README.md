# Treking in Nepal Analysis

In this project, I have done web scraping from multiple treking sites to collect data and analyzed the data to make insightful results. 

Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization , ML models like linear regression and logistic regression are built and praticed in this project.

Python Libraries like numpy for mathmatical calculations, pandas for Dataframe , matplotlib and seaborn for Visualization are used in this project. Also ,scikit learn is used for building Machine Learning models.

The main aim of this project is to provide people features for comparing different Treking destinations in Nepal on basis of cost,time,difficulty level etc. It is also used for finding relation between different Parameters.
